Testing and Exploiting Buffer Overflows.

The following components were used as test environment:

- Windows 7 Ultimate x64
- [Vulnserver](http://sites.google.com/site/lupingreycorner/vulnserver.zip)
- [IMMUNITY DEBUGGER](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/index.html)
- [Mona.py](https://github.com/corelan/mona)



Test Connection to vulnserver
### STEP 1:Test Connetion

### STEP 2: Building a fuzzer
The fuzzing script should crash vulnserver around 2100 Bytes


### STEP 3: Find the offset 
After we know when the vulnserver crashes, we create a pattern of bytes.

To create the pattern we can use pattern_create -l 2100


### STEP 4: Overwrite EIP

### STEP 5

### STEP 6: Generating shellcode


### Identify Bad Characters

### Determine Optimal Payload Length
