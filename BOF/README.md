Testing and Exploiting Buffer Overflows.

The following components were used as test environment:

- Windows 7 Ultimate x64
- [Vulnserver](http://sites.google.com/site/lupingreycorner/vulnserver.zip)
- [IMMUNITY DEBUGGER](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/index.html)

The goal of the buffer overflow is to create a reverse shell within the test environment.
