# Automate Pentesting with Python

In this repository you will find Python scripts that help to automate penetration testing. These were created during preparation for OSCP PWK certification. 

The "target" here is the "Damn Vulnerable Web App". You can get it from here: https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA. DVWA versions 1.07 and 1.10 were tested. 

The Python package mechanize was used to automate browser requests.

To make the scripts run on your environment you should adjust the values for RHOST, LHOST, PORT and Security Level if necessary.


#### Blind SQL Injection
- Executes boolen and time based SQL Injection
- Used csv file as input

#### Bruteforce with wordlist
- Brute force a given user based on a wordlist
- Used passwords.lst as input

#### Click Jacking Detector
-  Detects if the target is vulerable for clickjacking

#### Command Executing
- Sends command to DVWA which opens a reverse shell
- python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
