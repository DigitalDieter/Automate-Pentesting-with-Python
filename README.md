# Automate Pentesting with Python

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In this repository you will find Python scripts that help to automate penetration testing. These were created during preparation for OSCP PWK certification. 

The "Damn Vulnerable Web App" DVWA Version 1.07 and 1.10 was used to target. You can get it from here: [Click Me](https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA). For Stateful programmatic web browsing the [mechanize](https://mechanize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package was used.
Tested on Windows, Linux and MacOS. To make the scripts run on your environment you should adjust the values for RHOST, LHOST, PORT and Security Level if necessary.

<strong>These scripts are for educational purposes only.</strong>


#### Blind SQL Injection
- Executes boolean and time-based SQL Injection
- Used CSV file as input

#### Bruteforce with wordlist
- Brute force a given user based on a wordlist
- Used passwords.lst as input

#### Click Jacking Detector
-  Detects if the target is vulerable for clickjacking

#### Command Executing
- Sends command to DVWA which opens a reverse shell
- python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

#### HSTS Detector
- Detects if the target is vulnerable to for ssl-strip

- Executes Error based and Union based SQL Injection
- Used sqli.csv as input
