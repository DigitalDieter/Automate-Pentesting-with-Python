# Automate Pentesting with Python

In this repository you will find Python scripts that help to automate penetration testing. The scripts were created during the preparation for the OSCP-PWK certification.


The "Damn Vulnerable Web App" serves as "target" here. You you can get it form here: https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA

I have use mechanize to automate the browser requests.
