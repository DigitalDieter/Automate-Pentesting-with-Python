# Automate Pentesting with Python

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In this repository you will find Python scripts that help automate penetration testing. These were created during preparation for OSCP PWK certification. 

The "Damn Vulnerable Web App" DVWA Version 1.07 and 1.10 used as the target. You can get it from here: [Click Me](https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA). For Stateful programmatic web browsing, the [mechanize](https://mechanize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package was used.
Tested on Windows, Linux, and macOS. To make the scripts run on your environment, you should adjust the values for RHOST, LHOST, PORT, and Security Level if necessary.

<strong>These scripts are for educational purposes only.</strong>

#### To getting started just copy & paste these lines of code.
    git clone https://github.com/DigitalDieter/Automate-Pentesting-with-Python.git
    cd Automate-Pentesting-with-Python.git
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Blind SQL Injection
- Executes Boolean and Time-based SQL Injection
- Used blind-sqli.csv file as input

#### Bruteforce with wordlist
- Brute force a given user based on a wordlist
- Used passwords.lst file as input

#### ClickJacking Detector
-  Detects if the target is vulnerable for clickjacking

![CJ-Detector](mechanize/demo/cj-detector.gif)

#### Command Executing
- Sends a command to DVWA which spawns a netcat reverse shell
- To break out from restricted environment use the following command
-     python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

- Detects if the target is vulnerable to for SSL-strip

- Executes Error and Union-based SQL Injection
- Used sqli.csv file as input
