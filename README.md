# Automate Pentesting with Python

In this repository you will find Python scripts that help to automate penetration testing. The scripts were created during the preparation for the OSCP-PWK certification.
cd 
The "Damn Vulnerable Web App" serves as "target" here. You you can get it form here: https://github.com/ethicalhack3r/DVWA . The scripts were tested with DVWA versions 1.07 and 1.10.

I have used mechanize to automate the browser requests.

Edit RHOST IP to the  IP used by your DVWA instance.
